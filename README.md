This was a university project :
I led a team of 8 people, creating "Vilnius
TECH" app, I used **Trello** to track tasks,
For critical work deadlines, I made a setting in **Gantt
diagram**. I managed the project files and versions using
Git. I have compiled and used **FireBase** database.
For the design and logic of the app my team and I used:
**react-native**, **html**, **CSS**.
